# DeepTLF Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the DeepTLF package.

## Files

1. `minimal_example.py`: A minimal Python script demonstrating both classification and regression tasks using synthetic data.
2. `DeepTLF_example.ipynb`: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook with detailed examples and explanations.

## Running the Examples

### Minimal Example

To run the minimal example:

```bash
python minimal_example.py
```

This script will:
1. Generate synthetic data for both classification and regression
2. Train DeepTLF models on both tasks
3. Make predictions and show performance metrics

### Jupyter Notebook

To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook DeepTLF_example.ipynb
```

The notebook contains:
- Detailed explanations of DeepTLF functionality
- Real-world dataset examples
- Visualization of results
- Parameter tuning examples

## Requirements

Make sure you have DeepTLF installed:
```bash
pip install deeptlf
```

Additional requirements for the examples:
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- jupyter (for notebook example)
- matplotlib (for visualizations in notebook)
